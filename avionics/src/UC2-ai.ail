					rationale: "To introduce concurrent/parallel processing can reduce the processing time by reducing blocked time. Parallel computing and increasing resources can reduce the time to achieve the expected latency"

			QA: PERFORMANCE 
			rationale: "If requests can be processed in parallel, the blocked time can be reduced. Concurrency can be introduced by processing different streams of events on different threads or by creating additional threads to process different sets of activities" 
			stimulus: "Events arrive"
			response: "Response generated within time constraints"

			QA: PERFORMANCE 
			rationale: "Faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks all have the potential for reducing latency"
